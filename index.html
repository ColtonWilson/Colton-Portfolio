                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>In college, I was blessed with the opportunity tp choose between two universities.
                    One path where I could follow my brain and get a bachelor's in Computer Science and
                    another will I could follow my heart and be a member of an NCAA Men's Swim team
                    but have to get a degree in Applied Mathematics since they did not offer any
                    Computer Science or Engineering programs. I choose the latter and decided that not many
                    people get the opportunity to compete on a collegiate level and I could always further
                    my education with Computer Science. 
                    <br>
                    After College I found myself more in need of financial support than taking on more debt.
                    I was recruited by some companies and decided it was in my best interest to work for a few
                    years to build up a savings. After about five years, I found myself being very successful and
                    was the youngest manager in the company. I did not want to start over and so y dreams of going 
                    back to school were a distant thought. 
                    <br>
                    Then in 2020 the world saw a life-changing pandemic and the line of work I was in was not sure 
                    if they would stay open. I was offered a chance to leave and I took it as a sign to go and
                    do something else. I started taking some night classes where I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                    but it still wasn't scratching my need to learn. I started looking at some schools and I found
                    Syracuse University had the best alignment for what I was looking for in a school. For the next
                    two years I found myself working part-time while being full-time with getting my Master's in Computer
                    Science. I learned a lot of new languages like C++, Python, and SQL and some great topics like
                    computer and network security, data mining, and  object oriented programming.
                    <br>
                    I currently work as a data analyst in digital products for Target and am already beginning to 
                    learn so much more than I could have imagined. I enjoy learning and continue to take classes to
                    improve my front-end programming. I would like to continue learning and adding more languages 
                    and techniques to my tool-kit.
